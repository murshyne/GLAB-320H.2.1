# React Application

## Description

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of state management with hooks. The application features a button that toggles messages and content when clicked, providing an interactive user experience. 

## Features

- Displays a header and footer.
- Contains a button that, when clicked, alternates messages.
- Updates content based on the current state of messages.
- Uses functional components and hooks for state management.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Components

### `App.js`

The main component of the application, which manages the state and renders other components. It includes:

- **Header**: Displays the header of the application.
- **Button**: A button that toggles between different messages and updates content when clicked.
- **Content**: Displays different colored content messages based on the current state.
- **Footer**: Displays the footer of the application.

### State Management

The `App` component manages two pieces of state:

- **message**: Initially set to "Wish me luck...🙁". This message toggles between "Wish me luck...🙁" and "I don't need luck...😁" when the button is clicked.
  
- **contentText**: Initially set to "I think I've got it!". This toggles between "I think I've got it!" and "I got this, HECKING YEAH!!! 🤟" when the button is clicked.

## Usage

Click the button to toggle between the following messages:

- **Message**: Alternates between "Wish me luck...🙁" and "I don't need luck...😁".
- **Content Text**: Alternates between "I think I've got it!" and "I got this, HECKING YEAH!!! 🤟".
